        <strong>SeizureSavvy</strong> is a comprehensive Progressive Web App designed to enhance the management and prediction of seizure episodes through sophisticated data logging and machine learning technology. It allows users to complete daily surveys where they track seizure episodes they had and log symptoms, including triggers, prodromes and auras, they experienced. It also helps users track their medications. Users receive predictive alerts for episodes to ensure safety and get insights into symptoms correlated with their episodes. The app features an intuitive design for ease of use and strict data privacy measures to protect personal health information. SeizureSavvy combines technology with personal care, making it an essential tool for individuals seeking proactive seizure management. SeizureSavvy is the future of personalized seizure care that every individual with seizures need.

### Machine Learning

Our application utilizes advanced machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and understand feature importance:

#### Seizure Prediction Model
For predicting the probability of seizure occurrences, we use an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network**. This model is ideal for dealing with sequences of data and can remember information for long periods, which is crucial for our needs. It not only considers the immediate data (e.g., today's symptoms) but also the overall pattern over recent days. This approach helps in capturing the complexities of seizure occurrences more accurately. We trained the LSTM on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mirror real-life symptom patterns by defining and sampling from probability distributions for each feature.

#### Feature Importance Analysis
To understand which symptoms (features) significantly impact seizure prediction, we employ the **XGBoost model**, an ensemble of decision trees. XGBoost provides built-in methods to calculate feature importance scores, which are invaluable for our analysis. These scores are determined based on the frequency of a feature's use in the trees and its effectiveness in reducing prediction error, thus highlighting critical predictors in seizure episodes.

<!-- Installation -->
## Installation

This guide will take you through the steps to get SeizureSavvy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these detailed instructions to set up both the backend and frontend parts of the application.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.9 or later (3.11 recommended for optimal performance)
- Node.js and npm (npm is typically installed with Node.js)
- Yarn package manager

### Backend Setup

1. **Python Environment Setup**
   - Open your terminal and ensure you are in the root directory of the cloned project.
   - Navigate to the `api` subdirectory:
     ```bash
     cd api
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies separately from your global Python setup:
     ```bash
     python3.11 -m venv venv  # Use `python3` if `python3.11` is not recognized
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
   - With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt  # Use `pip3` if `pip` is not configured for Python 3
     ```
   - If using Anaconda or another Python distribution, ensure no other Python environment is active to avoid conflicts:
     ```bash
     conda deactivate
     ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**
   - With the dependencies installed and the virtual environment active, start the Flask backend server:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - The server will start and typically listen on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Installing Node Dependencies**
   - Ensure that your terminal is in the project's root directory.
   - Install Yarn globally if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     npm install --global yarn
     ```
   - Install the project's Node.js dependencies:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

2. **Building the Frontend**
   - Build the static assets for the frontend application:
     ```bash
     yarn build
     ```

3. **Starting the Frontend Server**
   - With the build complete, you can now start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     yarn start
     ```
   - This will usually launch the frontend and automatically open a new tab in your default web browser pointing to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Verifying the Installation

After both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the SeizureSavvy application running. Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend by performing actions that require backend interaction.
